Originally based on lessons developed by The Carpentries, Library Carpentry’s aim is to teach librarians, archivists, and other information workers how to automate tasks, create, maintain, and analyze sustainable and reusable data, work effectively with IT and systems colleagues, and better understand the use of software in research. Training takes place in face-to-face workshops.

# Detailed structure

## Part 1: Introduction to Data

There is one lesson in this section. The first half of the lesson is a question and answer activity that allows participants to explore concepts or jargon around software development and data science. The second half of the lesson explores regular expressions or pattern matching to find, manage, and transform data and files.
