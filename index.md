Library Carpentry’s aim is to teach people working in library- and information-related roles how to automate tasks, create, maintain, and analyze sustainable and reusable data, work effectively with IT and systems colleagues, and better understand the use of software in research. Training takes place mainly in face-to-face workshops. To learn more about our workshops, see [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/).

# Workshop Structure

## Parts vs Days
Feedback from the Library Carpentry community points to the importance of offering greater flexibility in the delivery of Library Carpentry training, citing the difficulty that many in library- and information-related roles have in getting time off for training. This might mean running training in half day blocks, rather than as a two-day chunk. In addition, flexibility may be needed to meet the needs or preferences of the community and host/organiser. 

Instead of requiring “Days” like Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry, “Parts” are used to allow for the flexibility desired by the Library Carpentry community. If a standard workshop (which includes three of the four core lessons) cannot be held across two consecutive days, then alternatively, it can be run in parts across a number of days. As long as three of the four core lessons are taught, it makes no difference whether the workshop is run in one day, two days, or multiple days.

Based on the feedback from Library Carpentry (and the greater Carpentries) community, The Carpentries is doing more to include flexibility in the organisation of workshops. See [Upcoming Updated Forms for Workshops & Workshop Section of The Carpentries Website](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/08/workshop-request-form-updates-teaser/).

## Core Lessons
For a standard Library Carpentry workshop, three of the four parts below must be taught in addition to having at least one certified Carpentries instructor teach the workshop. Alternatively, a Library Carpentry-based workshop can be considered, where part(s) of the core lessons are combined with the extended lessons to suite the needs of the community. 

### Part 1: Introduction to Working with Data

The lesson begins with a question and answer activity that allows participants to explore concepts or jargon around software development and data science. Then, the reasons behind why taking a computational approach is beneficial are covered. The latter half of the lesson explores regular expressions or pattern matching to find, manage, and transform data and files.

* [A Computational Approach](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/03-computational-approach/index.html) [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview)
* [Introduction to Working with Data (Regular Expressions)](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-data-intro/) [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro)
  
The following lesson episodes are optional:

* [Introduction to Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/01-intro-to-library-carpentry/index.html) [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview): For learners looking for an introduction to Library Carpentry and The Carpentries, for instance, as part of a shorter, pilot workshop (in connection with an event), or as a presentation at an event or to a community. 

* [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/03-keyboard-shortcuts/index.html) [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview): Introduce learners to keyboard shortcuts that will be used in the lesson and other lessons while learning that keyboard shortcuts are useful in automating tasks. A question and answer exercise allows workshop participants to learn from each other about new keyboard shortcuts.

* [File Naming & Formatting](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/05-file-naming-formatting/index.html) [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview): Introduce learners to good practices for file naming and organisation, open file formats such as Markdown, and open source software for working with open file formats. The Markdown exercise allows learners to gain experience using it ahead of lessons that include working with regular expressions and git. 

* [One Up, One Down](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-overview/06-one-up-down.md/index.html) [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview): Activity where the instructor alternates between each workshop participant asking them what they liked about the workshop or what needs improvement. Participants cannot repeat responses. Allows both instructors and participants an opportunity to reflect on the workshop (day).

## Part 2: Shell Lessons

This lesson includes information on navigating/working with files and directories, scripting, and finding things on the command line (shell).

## Part 3: Introduction to Git

This lesson introduces git on the command line and moves to using GitHub to collaborate, manage, version, and share your project or repository work.

  * [Introduction to Git](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-git/) [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-git)

## Part 4: OpenRefine

This lesson introduces OpenRefine, a software program that helps with transforming, cleaning, filtering, and analysing data files.

# Extended Lessons

There are a number of extended Library Carpentry lessons, in alpha and beta form, that are used to supplement and tailor workshops to the local needs of the community being taught. The lessons include:

  * [SQL](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-sql/)
  * [Webscraping](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-webscraping/)
  * [Tidy Data](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-spreadsheets/)
  * [Introduction to Python](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-python-intro/)
  * [Introduction to Data (for Archivists)](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-data-intro-archives/)

# Conceptual Lessons

In addition, the following lessons are conceptual (pre-alpha) and still in a design phase where community members are discussing them and/or lesson development is still in an early phase:

  * [Wikidata](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-sql/)
  * [FAIR Data & Software](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-webscraping/)
  * [R](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-spreadsheets/)
  * [MarcEdit](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-python-intro/)
  * [Text & Data Mining](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-data-intro-archives/)
