## One-Up, One-Down

In addition to minute cards, we also ask learners to give us feedback at the end
of each day using a technique called "one up, one down".  The
instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one
negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
already been said.  This requirement forces people to say things they
otherwise might not: once all the "safe" feedback has been given,
participants will start saying what they really think. The instructor
writes down the feedback in the Etherpad or a text editor,
but does not comment on the feedback while collecting it. The instructors then
discuss this feedback and how they plan to act on it. Like with minute cards, be explicit
about how you're responding to learner feedback.
