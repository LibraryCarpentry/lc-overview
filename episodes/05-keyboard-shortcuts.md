### Keyboard shortcuts are your friend

Though we will get more computational over the course of the programme, we can start our adventure into programming - as many of you will have already - with very simple things like keyboard shortcuts. We all have our favourites that are labour saving but also allow us to use this machine in the best possible way. You can do all the lessons in Library Carpentry without keyboard shortcuts, but note that they'll likely come up a lot.

Action | Windows | Mac | + Keystroke
--- | --- | --- | --- |
Save | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | <kbd>Command</kbd> | + <kbd>S</kbd>
Copy | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | <kbd>Command</kbd> | + <kbd>C</kbd>
Cut | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | <kbd>Command</kbd> | + <kbd>X</kbd>
Paste | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | <kbd>Command</kbd> | + <kbd>V</kbd>
Switch Applications | <kbd>Alt</kbd> | <kbd>Command</kbd> | <kbd>Tab</kbd> |

Keyboard shortcuts are the first step towards automation. Sometimes you donâ€™t have to write a programming script or use a program to automate.
