## Laura Liaison

Laura Liaison received a B.Sc. in biology 2 years ago, and shortly after a fellowship at the Technical University Library, decided to go back to State Library School where she obtained her MLIS. While in library school she completed a class on Database Management where she learned about database design and programming. Laura also attended a one-day training event on web publishing where she had initial exposure to scripting.

Laura recently started working for Ivy University Library as a Research Librarian for the life sciences where her biology background was seen as an asset to building closer relationships with the life sciences faculty at the University. Laura has found that the school and departments in the life sciences have had a difficult time tracking and reporting the research outputs of their faculty, which make it difficult to communicate their impact and gather data for tenure and promotions. The school and departments in the life sciences have asked her to assist them. She has identified a number of databases where a majority of the publications can be found but she still has to track down other sources where the faculty publishes. She gathers all the information she finds by manually searching for and downloading data as CSV files every month and importing them into Excel where she does some cleaning, formatting, and analysis which she shares. The process can take days to complete and it pulls her away from other liaison activities. Laura would like to automate the process and spend more time on her other liaison activities.

She finds it difficult to concentrate when she is at work as she is asked to wear many hats in her role and there are frequent interruptions. She spends most of her time scanning databases and working in Excel in the evenings and weekends at home.

Library Carpentry will teach Laura how to automate this task by using data cleaning tools and basic scripting to retrieve, clean, and format reports. Those combination of scripts and data tools will download data from database APIs or folders, compile the data where additional data cleaning macros can be applied, formatted for reporting, and versioned in a shared repository. These new skills will save Laura 8-10 hours a month.


## Maria Metadata

Maria Metadata received her B.A. in history 32 years ago. As an undergraduate student she joined the University College Library as a library assistant in Circulation Services. After 4 years in Circulation Services, she joined Cataloging Services where she helped process materials. She moved up in in the organization spending several years as a cataloger, then as a team lead and finally as a manager of the Electronic Resources team in the merged Acquisitions & Cataloging Department.

Maria's team has been managing electronic resources data in Excel spreadsheets on a shared drive which is somewhat organized. They have been able to get by and maintain services but have also discussed systems that may be able to help them. However, it takes time to investigate a system and include the various members of the community that need to be involved in the decision, not to mention money. There has been increasing pressure to find cost savings in the electronic resources budget and recently the head of the department asked Maria and her team to find significant savings as the Library and the University are looking for ways to respond to a reduction in funding from the state government. Maria hired a team member, Alexia, who has a technical background, to help the team with adopting new approaches and tools, but some of the team members are still struggling with the gap in their skills, including Maria. Alexia suggests that the team consider a data skills training program.

Maria has learned new skills at every stage of her career but questions whether she and members of her staff can really learn some of the data approaches and tools that Alexia has mentioned. She does not have time after work to devote to training, and her schedule changes too quickly for her to consistently commit time to professional development. 

Library Carpentry training will allow the team to explore and leverage data management, SQL, Python, OpenRefine, and collaboration and versions via Git. The training will allow Maria and her team to be on the same page and understand how they can use these tools and approaches to improve their workflows and reporting. Library Carpentry also offers the flexibility her group needs to train when Maria and staff are available. 

## Eckswhy Zed

Eckswhy Zed is a data librarian who advocates for better data management practices across all disciplines at her university. Researchers at her university undertake data intensive research and she feels that her knowledge about their data needs is limited. Eckswhy believes that if she knew more about the challenges these researchers faced with managing their data she would be able to converse further and connect them to resources they were not aware of through the libraries and/or the wider university.

She has experience providing basic research support, delivering presentations and training, conducting reference interviews, and providing guidance on data management plans (DMPs). Eckswhy also has a background in user experience studies with web GUIs, collaborative platforms, and databases. She has used Excel and Filemaker to record outreach activities and evaluate training events.

Many of her goals involve expanding the library's research data services. She would like to inform and connect researchers with national data policies and infrastructure. Eckswhy wishes to advise researchers on metadata, data and technical resources they were unaware of, especially with regard to DMPs and data sharing. She hopes to be able to talk to IT, relay researcher needs/requirements to inform new products and services which Library Carpentry can help with. 

## Yerosan Jared

Yerosan Jared earned a Masterâ€™s degree from Addis Ababa University School of Information Science. He has been working as a librarian in one of the oldest libraries at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia Kennedy Library. Recently, he has been promoted to the position of Data Curator for the electronic library. Even though he is excited about the new role, there is also the looming responsibility of working with his library group and community to bring about collective changes in the library's (data) services and provide guidance on emerging data (science) related roles. 

Via previous roles and academic experience he has knowledge of various automated tools in libraries (both open and proprietary), programming languages such as SQL, Oracle, and is familiar with tools such as bash, command-line, regex, git, spreadsheets, but not confident enough. 

Recently, a teammate asked him if he knows how to clean, merge, transform library metadata to be used for policy and management decision making. He will need to employ his knowledge of software and data while engaging with and working with library team members. 

Yerosan is eager to have experience or training in data curation, including metadata generation and management. He would like to have the knowledge to demonstrate scientific data management policies and practices to support internal data sharing and external open data publishing, to also gain experience working with data repositories. 

Library Carpentry will teach Yerosan to clean, integrate, modify and visualise the metadata in a disciplined way, to debug programs systematically, and use tools to communicate data internally and externally.
