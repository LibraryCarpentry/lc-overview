## Campus trends
With the emergence of our ability to generate increasing amounts of data, research and work in almost every domain has a data and computational component, including the whole new field of data science.

### Libraries are guided by the needs of their communities...
- Surveys point to an increasing need from researchers for data & software skills
- Researchers do not receive the training they need in software best practices
- Many universities are integrating data science into the curriculum
- Industry is looking to hire more data savvy candidates
- Early career researchers are looking for career advancement opportunities

### Unmet needs
According to Barone L,  Williams J and Micklos D. [Unmet Needs for Analyzing Biological Big Data: A Survey of 704 NSF Principal Investigators](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755) (2017):

- Nearly 90% of BIO PIs said they are currently/will soon be analyzing large data sets
- Majority of PIs said their institutions are not meeting 9 of 13 needs
- Training on integration of multiple data types (89%), on data management and metadata (78%), and on scaling analysis to cloud/HPC (71%) were the 3 greatest unmet needs
- Data storage and HPC ranked lowest on their list of unmet needs
- The problem is the growing gap between the accumulation of big data—and researchers’ knowledge about how to use it effectively


![Fig 3. Unmet data analysis needs of National Science Foundation (NSF) Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) principal investigators (PIs) (percent responding negatively, 318 ≤ n ≤ 510).](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=large&download=&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755.g003)

In a survey of biology NSF PIs, the top 3 unmet needs are around training

### Importance of research software & training
- 92% of academics use research software
- 69% say that their research would not be practical without it
- 56% develop their own software (worryingly, 21% of those have no training in software development)

### Educational Pathways
Academic institutions should provide and evolve a range of educational pathways to prepare students for an array of data science roles in the workplace.

### Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments
On our campuses, library spaces have been transformed—among other things—into campus centers for data science research, training, and services, with open floor plans and furnishings that are adaptable to a range of activities that promote and support data science research and learning.

### The Carpentries workshops and lesson materials address data and software needs.

### Training in data science tools and approaches provides a path to better science in less time.

### Our path to better science in less time using open science tools
Reproducibility has long been a tenet of science but has been challenging to achieve—we learned this the hard way when our old approaches proved inadequate to efficiently reproduce our own work. Here we describe how several free software tools have fundamentally upgraded our approach to collaborative research, making our entire workflow more transparent and streamlined. By describing specific tools and how we incrementally began using them for the Ocean Health Index project, we hope to encourage others in the scientific community to do the same—so we can all produce better science in less time.

## Challenges & opportunities for libraries
      
### The Strategic Value of Library Carpentry & The Carpentries to Research Libraries		

For libraries, organizing Data, Software, and Library workshops and meet-ups have provided an excellent opportunity to connect with their community, understand their data and software needs, and grow their library services.

- Cut through the jargon terms and phrases
- Learn how to apply data science concepts in library tasks
- Identify and use best practices in data structures
- Learn how to programmatically clean and transform data
- Work effectively with researchers, IT, and systems colleagues
- Automate repetitive, error prone tasks

### 38 mentions of The Carpentries in [The Shifting to Data Savvy Report](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33891/).

### Demonstrated need from libraries
- Since 2013, roughly 120 Library Carpentry workshops have been held in 16 countries addressing software and data training needs from data cleaning in OpenRefine to versioning your work with Git.

### Expanding Library Carpentry
The California Digital Library will advance the scope, adoption, and impact of the emergent "Library Carpentry" continuing education program... The training opportunities enabled by the project will provide librarians with the critical data and computational skills and tools they need to be effective digital stewards for their stakeholders and user communities. 

See Institute of Museum and Library Services Grant [RE-85-17-0121-17](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-85-17-0121-17) 

### On April 17, 2018, the California Digital Library [welcomed Chris Erdmann, Library Carpentry Community and Development Director](https://www.cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2018/04/17/welcome-chris-erdmann-library-carpentry-community-and-development-director/) to help grow the Library Carpentry effort. 

### Growing Library Carpentry involves:
- Development and updates of core training modules optimized for the librarian community, based on Carpentries pedagogy
- Regionally-organized training opportunities for librarians, leading to an expanding cohort of certified instructors available to train fellow librarians in critical skills and tools, such as the command line, OpenRefine, Python, R, SQL, and research data management
- Community outreach to raise awareness of Library Carpentry and promote the development of a broad, engaged community of support to sustain the movement and to advance LC integration within the newly forming Carpentries organization

### Focus of Data, Software, and Library Carpentry
- **Data Carpentry** workshops are domain-specific, and focus on teaching skills for working with data effectively and reproducibly.
- **Software Carpentry** workshops are domain-agnostic, and teach the Unix Shell, coding in R or Python, and version control using Git (i.e. Research software workflows).
- **Library Carpentry** workshops focus on teaching software and data skills for people working in library- and information-related roles. The workshops are domain-agnostic though datasets used will be familiar to library staff (i.e. Automating workflows, data cleaning, outreach to researchers/IT).

### The Carpentries workshop goals
- Teach skills
- Get people started and introduce them to what’s possible
- Build confidence in using these skills
- Encourage people to continue learning
- Positive learning experience

### Goals of the workshop, aren’t just to teach the skills, but to build self-efficacy and increase confidence and create a positive learning experience. We know we can’t teach everything in two days, but we want to teach the foundational skills and get people started and give them the confidence to continue learning. Many people have had demotivating experience when learning things like coding or computational skills, and we want to change that perspective.

### Instructor training
Educational pedagogy is the focus of Instructor training program. The following steps are required to become a certified Instructor who can teach all Carpentries lessons!
- 2-days of online training in the pedagogy
- Suggest a change to a lesson on GitHub
- 1-hr online discussion on running/teaching workshops
