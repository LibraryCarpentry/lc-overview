## Library Carpentry and The Carpentries

[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) is one of three Lesson Programs that make up [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Where Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are aimed at researchers in a variety of fields, Library Carpentry was developed specifically with the needs of library and information-related communities in mind. "Our goal is to empower people in these roles to use software and data in their own work and to become advocates for and train others in efficient, effective and reproducible data and software practices." [(Library Carpentry About Us)](https://librarycarpentry.org/about/)

The lessons that make up the Library Carpentry curriculum are always evolving, with new lessons being developed as needs arise. The Core Curriculum includes Introduction to Data (this lesson), Unix Shell, Git, and OpenRefine, but the lessons are also taught individually or in combination with other lessons from from [the expanded curriculum](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/). 

Library Carpentry workshops follow [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). Please be respectful of everyone in the workshop; we are all here to learn and support each other as we expand our knowledge.

## Data in Libraries

There are many sources of data in libraries and they are often stored independent of each other. Some examples are:
- bibliographic information about physical collections
- circulation statistics
- metadata from items in institutional repositories
- reference and instruction statistics
- responses to surveys or other forms of feedback 
- journal and ebook turn-aways
- gate counts

These are just a few examples of the kinds of data that you can use to better understand your library's collections, services, spaces, and community.
